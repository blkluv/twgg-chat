        Imagine you're watching a video of your favorite streamer on Twitch, and you want to see what people were saying in the chat 💬 while the stream was happening. 
      </br>
      To do that, you need to change the web link (the address at the top of your internet browser). You want to add "<strong>gg</strong>" after the word "twitch" in the link. 
      </br>
      So the link would look like this: "www.twitchgg.com/streamername."
      </br>
      By adding "<strong>gg</strong>" like that, you might be able to replay the chat and see what everyone was talking about during the stream. It's like going back in time to read the chat messages again! 🔄
